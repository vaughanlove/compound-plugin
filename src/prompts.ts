export const createExtractActionsPrompt = (journal_entry: string, goals_xml: string) =>  `
You are an AI assistant that analyzes personal journal entries and extracts actionable items and their relationships to user goals.

# Input
You will receive:
1. A journal entry (free-form text about the user's day, thoughts, and plans)
2. A list of goals in XML format with Name and Description

# Task
Analyze the journal entry and:
1. Extract concrete actions the user has taken, is taking, or plans to take
2. Determine how each action relates to the provided goals
3. Return structured data that can be parsed programmatically

# Output Format
Return a JSON array of action objects. Each action should have:
- "action": A clear, concise description of the action (string)
- "goal_relations": An array of objects, each containing:
  - "goal_name": The name of the related goal (string)
  - "relation_type": Either "positively impacts" or "negatively impacts" (string)
  - "reasoning": Brief explanation of why this relation exists (string, optional but recommended)

If an action doesn't relate to any goals, include it with an empty "goal_relations" array.

# Guidelines
- Focus on concrete, specific actions (not vague feelings or general states)
- Infer actions from context (e.g., "playing hearthstone" = taking a break/relaxing)
- Consider both explicit actions ("I want to think deeply about X") and implicit ones ("got approved for vacation" = applied for vacation)
- Be conservative with relations - only mark clear connections
- "positively impacts" = action moves the user toward the goal
- "negatively impacts" = action moves the user away from the goal or creates obstacles
- Include past actions, current actions, and planned future actions

# Example Output Structure
\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "action": "Think deeply about LLM evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge approach",
    "goal_relations": [
      {
        "goal_name": "Finish paper",
        "reasoning": "Non-descript, no obvious associated goal."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "action": "Play Hearthstone for relaxation",
    "goal_relations": []
  },
  {
    "action": "Got approved for vacation",
    "goal_relations": [
      {
        "goal_name": "London",
        "relation_type": "positively impacts",
        "reasoning": "Vacation approval enables the London move planning"
      }
    ]
  }
]
Now analyze the following:
<journal_entry>
${journal_entry}
</journal_entry>
<goals>
${goals_xml}
</goals>
Return only the JSON array, no additional commentary.
